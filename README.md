# Ada Firebase Demo App
The base app in this demo has a form for adding things and a form for displaying things. We'll deploy this app to Firebase, then hook up Firestore in order to get it to load/save data.

## Set up Hosting
Basically, you go to [Firebase Hosting](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/ada-demo-project/hosting/sites) in your project and follow the steps it walks you through!

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```



## Set up Firestore

## Set up auth and make per-user stores
This might be out of scope for the demo.
